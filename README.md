# geocoding
A collection of functions to quickly convert between Python objects and shapefiles/geojsons; to triangualte pixel coordinates of objects into geocoordinates.



shapefiling.py and geocoding.py are the core scripts. Unzip gdal_data.7z before running. Unzip examples.7z to run examples at the end of each script.

The scripts heavily depend on shapely, gdal and pyproj.
